## Helping Node devs get started with Docker since about now

Pleated Slacks is the comfortable way to get started with Docker,
just like Dockers are the comfortable way to wear slacks for work.
We analyze your package.json and suggest the Docker modules you'll
want to use to run your app's stack. You select which modules you
actually want, and we create your Docker Compose file for you.

1. npm install -g pleated-slacks
1. cd my-repo
1. slacks
1. Follow the prompts
1. Enjoy the auto-created Docker Compose file!
